<p> My name is Kelsi Day, I am 19 years old and a freshman at the University of Maine working towards my business managements degree in order to own my own business one day. I graduated Brewer High School in 2018 and I am now currently living in Orono, Maine and plan to continue to live here until I graduate from the University. I come from a pretty normal family and grew up just a few minutes away in Brewer, Maine. I am currently working at Geaghans Pub in Bangor and have been there for about 2 years! I have 2 siblings, a twin sister and my brother who is 21 years old. Their names are Kassi and Ryan Day. My parents have been split up since I was 10 years old. My dad is a travel nurse so he has been to just about every state in the country and is now currently living in Georgia. Most of my life I have lived with my mom, sister and brother along with my 3 cats a 1 dog. My cats names are Mia, Little blue and Tux. Mia and Little Blue are 10 years old and Tux is 2 years old. My dogs name is Konan and he is 6 years old. I am a very outgoing/easygoing person and I love to play soccer, shop and hangout with friends in my free time. I wanted to make my website about me and my siblings! </p>
