This is my brother Ryan. He is 21 years old and a freshman at the University of Maine. Ryan graduated from Brewer High School in 2015 and went to UMaine the fall after graduation, but realized he wanted a break from school for a bit so he took a few years off of college to try and figure out what he wanted to do with his life. This year he really found himself and after taking a few classes at EMCC he realized he wanted to make a differnce in the world or at least touch as many people as he can in a positive way.  He currently lives in an apartment with his friends in Bangor and works at Hobby Lobby in his spare time. My brother has the biggest heart, but is also a weakness for him. My brother takes everything very personally and thinks when something bad happenes it's his fault. He cares for everyone and everything and he is attending UMaine in hopes to persue a career that will allow him to help people.

Ryan enjoys playing videogames, hanging out with his friends and eating. He is a very closed person and doesn't like to advertise his feelings so he always keeps a smile on his face no matter what! My brother has always felt out of place just because he didn't do the type of stuff guys our age are expected to do, like play sports, date girls and drive a car. He just got his license this past year and isnt comfortable dating yet, which is alright! But he takes what people say very personally. He is a great brother and will do anything for our family and I think qualities like that are what make him so unique and such a great guy and brother.
