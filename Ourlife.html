<h1>Our Life!</h1>

<h2>My family<3</h2>

Growing up we all had a pretty fortunate life. My siblings and I grew up in Brewer, Maine and we all lived with just my mom most of our lives. At 10 years old my parents split up so we would sometimes go to my dads on the weekends before he became a travel nurse. Every summer my whole family would go to our camp on Beech Hill and just spend time with all my cousins and grandparents. Life was great and easy until my grandfather died. My dad started traveling more, my grandmother remarried 2 years later, sold her house that we all loved and she almost sold our camp but of course my dad and uncle wouldnt let her. For a few years our family hit a rough patch but we are all finally back to where we use to be for the most part. My mom has always been our rock and angel on your shoulders. She does everything she can for us to have a good life and great future and I don't know where we would be without her. My dad is the person who makes sure we stay on track but still have fun. My brother is the person who keeps our family sane and our heads on our shoulder. He has no problem telling anyone whats right and wrong and will do anything for anyone. My sister is someone who will drop everything to pick someone up or get something for anyone. Our family as a whole works well together and without eachother we wouldn't be where we all are today. I love my family!

    This is my moms boyfriend. He is currently living with my mom now that we are all out of the house. His name is Brian but everyone calls him Nick. Brian has been like a second father to me when my dad has been gone, but he just received a job down in South Carolina so unfortunately he is leaving soon so that will take a toll on our family but with the support from everyone, we will all be alright just like we always are!
